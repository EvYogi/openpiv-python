Introduction

Why this project? 
-----------------
Particle Image Velocimetry is the state-of-the-art measurement technique and it's not so much magic behind the analysis of images that create velocity vector maps. Not so much magic is also in converting those velocity maps into very useful information for scientists, doctors and engineers. We started PIV at the times when the only available software was commercial, closed-source (who knew the open source then) and extremely buggy. We had to write our own algorithms to analyse our PIV data. We believe in open science, open engineering and open source. We believe in sharing and we believe in collaboration. Please, join us, if you share the same  vision. 


How this project has started? 
-----------------------------

This project started in 1998 by then graduate students, Roi Gurka and Alex Liberzon, under  supervision of Dr. Uri Shavit at the Technion, Haifa. At that time, the project was called (for the obvious reasons) URAPIV. The original software was written in Matlab (probably version 4 or 5) and released as an open source as a Matlab toolbox. 


Where this project is going? 
----------------------------

Our plans are to create a crowd minded open source alternative to the commercial source-closed projects that promise high quality and high reproducibility of the scientific and industrial PIV-based measurements and analysis.
